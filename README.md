# Even or Odd Checker 🔢

This Java program checks whether a given integer is **even** or **odd**.

---

## 📘 What Does It Do?

- Prompts the user to enter a number
- Validates if the input is an integer
- Checks if the number is divisible by 2
- Displays whether the number is even or odd

---

## 🧠 Logic Used

A number is:
- **Even** if `num % 2 == 0`
- **Odd** if `num % 2 != 0`

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac EvenOrOdd.java

## 🌟 Bulb Festival Program

In Ramapuram's annual festival, bulbs glow based on their number:
- 💚 Green: divisible by 3
- ❤️ Red: divisible by 5
- 💛 Yellow: divisible by both
- ⚫ Off: otherwise

This Java program takes user input for the total number of bulbs and prints their glow status.


# ✅ Perfect Number Checker

This program checks whether a given number is a **perfect number**. It is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python**, and demonstrates basic loop logic, divisor checking, and conditional output.

---

## 🧠 What Is a Perfect Number?

A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its **proper divisors** (excluding itself).

### 📌 Example:
- **6** → Divisors: 1, 2, 3 → Sum = 6 → ✅ Perfect
- **28** → Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → Sum = 28 → ✅ Perfect
- **12** → Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → Sum = 16 → ❌ Not Perfect

---

## 📥 Input

- A single integer `n` entered by the user.

## 📤 Output

- A message stating whether `n` is a perfect number or not.
