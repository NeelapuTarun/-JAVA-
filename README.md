- ⚫ Off: otherwise

This Java program takes user input for the total number of bulbs and prints their glow status.

## 🧠 What Is a Perfect Number?

A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its **proper divisors** (excluding itself).

### 📌 Example:
- **6** → Divisors: 1, 2, 3 → Sum = 6 → ✅ Perfect
- **28** → Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → Sum = 28 → ✅ Perfect
- **12** → Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → Sum = 16 → ❌ Not Perfect
