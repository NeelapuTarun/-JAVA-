# Sum of Numbers in a Given Range ➕🔢

This Java program calculates the **sum of all natural numbers** between a user-defined starting and ending value.

---

## 📘 What Does It Do?

- Prompts the user to enter a starting and ending number
- Validates the input range
- Calculates the sum of all numbers from `start` to `end` (inclusive)
- Displays the result

---

## 🧠 Logic Used

The program uses a simple `for` loop:
```java
for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    sum += i;
}

# Sum of First N Natural Numbers ➕🔢

This Java program calculates the **sum of the first `n` natural numbers** using a simple loop.

---

## 📘 What Does It Do?

- Uses a `for` loop to add numbers from `1` to `n`
- Displays the total sum

---

## 🧠 Logic Used

The program uses:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
